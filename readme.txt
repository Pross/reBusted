Force browsers to load the most recent file if modified.

== Description ==

Saves you from asking "have you emptied your cache?".

Forked and updated for todays WordPress and PHP from the original plugin by Paul Clark.

**Features**

* Safe to leave running on live sites.
* Only refreshes browser cache for a file if it has been modified.
* Resolves Content Delivery Network (CDN) issues. No need to purge CDN cache.
* Multisite compatible.
* "Just works" - no configuration necessary.

**Requirements**

Requires scripts use any of the below functions to load. Almost all files meet these requirements. The only case it doesn't account for is when URLs are hard-coded. This shouldn't ever be done, since it can break sites for other reasons.

* [wp_enqueue_script](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script)
